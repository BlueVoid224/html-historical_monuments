                    northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628 to 58) to
                    immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631,
                    having been the emperors inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India most famous and
                    widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right)
                    bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is
                    about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.

                Qutab Minar is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak immediately
                after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom. The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a
                projecting balcony and tapers from a 15 m diameter at the base to just 2.5 m at the top. The first three
                storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of marble and sandstone. At the foot
                of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the first mosque to be built in India. An inscription over
                its eastern gate provocatively informs that it was built with material obtained from demolishing '27
                Hindu temples'.

                    The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs, Amritsar. The Golden temple is famous
                    for its full golden dome, it is one of the most sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built
                    on a 67-ft square of marble and is a two storied structure. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper half
                    of the building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf. The Golden Temple is surrounded by a
                    number of other famous temples like the Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram Das, who
                    had initially constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple or Harmandir
                    Sahib. It is here that Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana. Rama and Sita are believed to have
                    spent their fourteen-year exile in Amritsar, the epicenter of Sikhism. To the south of the temple is
                    a garden, and the tower of Baba Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the Clock Tower. The ‘Guru Ka
                    Langar’ offers free food to around 20,000 people everyday.

                Lotus Temple, Bahāʾī Faith house of worship, or mashriq al-adhkār (Arabic: “a place where the uttering
                of the name of God arises at dawn”), in New Delhi. In the early 21st century it was one of only nine
                mashriqs in the world.
                The Lotus Temple was consecrated and opened to the public in December 1986. It was designed by Iranian
                architect Fariborz Sahba, who won acclaim for the project even before the temple was completed. It
                subsequently received several awardsThe Lotus Temple derives its name from its design. Like every other
                Bahāʾī mashriq, it is characterized by a nine-sided construction, in keeping with the Bahāʾī belief in
                the mystical properties of the number nine. Set on an elevated plinth in a 26-acre (10.5-hectare)
                expanse of landscaped gardens and surrounded by nine pools bordered by red sandstone walkways, the white
                marble edifice rises to a height of more than 130 feet (40 metres).

                Hawa Mahal or the 'Palace Of The Winds' located in the heart of the beautiful Pink City of Jaipur in
                Rajasthan, India, is one of the most famous tourist attractions and a prominent landmark of the city
                that is renowned for its rich cultural and architectural history. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap
                Singh of the Kachhwaha Rajput dynasty, this beautiful structure is predominantly a high screen wall made
                of pink and red sandstone that facilitated royal women to get an eyeful of the street festivals and busy
                city life while remaining out of the view of public. This five-storey building in the shape of a crown
                of Lord Krishna with 953 jharokhas or windows and a beautifully decorated façade resembling a honeycomb
                of a beehive that gives one a feel of the rich heritage of the Rajputs. One of the main reasons of
                constructing this beautiful mahal decorated with fine lattice windows and screened balconies was to
                facilitate the royal Rajput women.

                    India Gate is one of many British monuments built by order of the Imperial War Graves Commission
                    (later renamed Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The architect was Sir Edwin Lutyens, an
                    Englishman who designed numerous other war memorials and was also the principal planner of New
                    Delhi. The cornerstone was laid in 1921 by the duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria.
                    Construction of the All-India War Memorial, as it was originally known, continued until 1931, the
                    year of the formal dedication of New Delhi as the capital of India.

                Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors
                of the Mughal Dynasty till 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. The Agra fort is a
                UNESCO World Heritage site.It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj
                Mahal. The fort can described as a walled city.After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, the victorious
                Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of
                Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He
                was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when
                Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri’s general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing
                governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad. Sheesh Mahal, Agra Fort:The

                    historic monument located at the heart of Hyderabad, west-central Telangana state, south-central
                    India. The city, which is the capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states, was also the
                    capital of the historic princely state of Hyderabad.

                    The monument was built in 1591 by Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah, the fifth king of the Quṭb Shāhī dynasty,
                    reportedly as the first building in Hyderabad, his new capital. Over the years, it has become a
                    signature monument to and an iconic symbol of the city’s heritage. According to one legend, the
                    Hyderabad region was reeling from a devastating plague at the time that Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah was
                    shifting his capital from nearby Golconda to the new city. He commemorated the end of the plague by
                    building a mosque, which became known as Charminar because of its four towering and distinctive
                    minarets, one on each of the building’s four corners. It formed the centrepiece around which
                    Hyderabad was planned.

                The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, in Mumbai, is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving from Indian traditional architecture. The building, designed by the British architect F. W. Stevens, became the symbol of Bombay as the ‘Gothic City’ and the major international mercantile port of India. The terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878, according to a High Victorian Gothic design based on late medieval Italian models. Its remarkable stone dome, turrets, pointed arches and eccentric ground plan are close to traditional Indian palace architecture. It is an outstanding example of the meeting of two cultures, as British architects worked with Indian craftsmen to include Indian architectural tradition and idioms thus forging a new style unique to Bombay.

                The Victoria Memorial, a huge monument made of white marble located in the heart of the City of Joy, Kolkata (erstwhile Calcutta) in West Bengal, India is one of the most famous monuments in West Bengal that has become a museum and popular tourist spot of the state. A brainchild of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and Viceroy of India, this monument epitomising beauty and elegance was dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria (1819–1901). This grand and exquisite memorial not only stands as reminiscence to the rule of British Crown in the Indian subcontinent but also stands out as an excellent architectural gem in Indo-Saracenic revivalist style. It is a must visit tourist destination for first time visitors to experience the essence of Victorian era in the midst of the bustling metro city of Kolkata.

                    The Great Stupa at Sanchi has been the focal point of the Buddhist faith in the region since it was built by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. The grand structure still inspires awe today and sits at the top of a hill, surrounded by the remains of smaller stupas, monasteries, and temples that were built as the religious community grew in the centuries after the site was founded.
                    Despite its impressive scale today, the original Ashokan stupa was about half the size and built from large bricks and mud mortar. It’s believed it had raised terraces at the base, was enclosed by a wooden railing, and was crowned by a stone umbrella. The stupa was enlarged using local sandstone during the Sunga period, which began about 50 years after Ashoka’s death. The elaborately-carved gateways were added later, in the 1st century BC.

                Khajuraho Temples are among the most beautiful medieval monuments in the country. These temples were built by the Chandella ruler between AD 900 and 1130. It was the golden period of Chandella rulers. It is presumed that it was every Chandella ruler has built atleast one temple in his lifetime. So all Khajuraho Temples are not constructed by any single Chandella ruler but Temple building was a tradition of Chandella rulers and followed by almost all rulers of Chandella dynasty.
The first recorded mention of the Khajuraho temples is in the accounts of Abu Rihan al Biruni in AD 1022 and the Arab traveler Ibn Battuta in AD 1335. Local tradition lists 85 temples in Khajuraho out of which only 25 temples are surviving after various stages of preservation and care. All these temples are scattered over an area of about 9 square miles.

                    Fatehpur Sikri is located in Agra District in the State of Uttar Pradesh in northern India. It was constructed southeast of an artificial lake, on the slopping levels of the outcrops of the Vindhyan hill ranges. Known as the “city of victory”, it was made capital by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605 CE) and constructed between 1571 and 1573. Fatehpur Sikri was the first planned city of the Mughals to be marked by magnificent administrative, residential, and religious buildings comprised of palaces, public buildings, mosques, and living areas for the court, the army, the servants of the king and an entire city. Upon moving the capital to Lahore in 1585, Fatehpur Sikri remained as an area for temporary visits by the Mughal emperors.

                Sun Temple, also called Surya Deula or Surya Deul, temple in Konark, Odisha state, India, that is dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya. It was built in the 13th century.
                The Sun Temple is the pinnacle of Hindu Orissan architecture and is unique in terms of its sculptural innovations and the quality of its carvings. According to textual evidence, it is believed that Narasimha I (who reigned between 1238 and 1264) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty commissioned the temple. This is plausible as secular events are also depicted on its reliefs. The Sun Temple may have been built to celebrate Narasimha’s military victory over Muslim forces in Bengal. In this way, he would have intended to legitimize his right to rule as though appointed by the gods.
